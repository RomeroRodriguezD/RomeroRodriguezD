### Hello there!

I'm David someone who enjoys programming and learning more about it every day. I'm not quite good talking about myself, til the point I'd rather just show things that can talk about me, so here's some stuff I've worked with so far, for professional and/or personal interest, some of the technologies can be found on my repositories:

+ ðŸ’¬ OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras for Computer Vision and Deep Learning stuff.
+ ðŸ’¬ Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms.
+ ðŸ’¬ Flask & Django for web development and small API's.
+ ðŸ’¬ Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
+ ðŸ’¬ MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy engines. 
+ ðŸ’¬ Web scrapping and automation of browser-based tasks with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
+ ðŸ’¬ Testing engineering through Behave / Gherkin.
+ ðŸ’¬ Developing Graphic User Interfaces with Tkinter / PyQT.
