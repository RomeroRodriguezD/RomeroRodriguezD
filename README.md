I'm David someone who enjoys programming and learning more about it every day. I'm not quite good talking about myself, til the point I'd rather just show things that can talk about me, so here's some stuff I've worked with so far, for professional and/or personal interest, some of the technologies can be found on my repositories:

+ ðŸ’¬ OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras for Computer Vision stuff.
+ ðŸ’¬ Flask & Django for web development and small API's.
+ ðŸ’¬ Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
+ ðŸ’¬ MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite are my main data persistence weapons.
+ ðŸ’¬ Web scrapping and automation of browser-based tasks with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
+ ðŸ’¬ Developing Graphic User Interfaces with Tkinter.
+ ðŸ’¬ Automation of desktop tasks with libraries like Pyautogui or Autohotkey.

Short summary for lazy fellas:
